A project which will convert plain text to handwritten like image

A python based project which will take image as plain text and give a image containing the text in handwritten like format

# Requirements
1. python3.6+
2. PIL library must be installed

All the necessary image files must be in the same directory as the python script

Run the script and it will prompt the user to enter the text.
As soon as the input is completed the image will be formed and shown.

You can decide to save it or not by taking a screenshot or whatever


# NOTE
This is an example of the generated file, the image size can be handled from A4 to A3
