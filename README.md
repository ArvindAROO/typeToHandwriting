# typeToHandwriting
A project which will convert plain text to handwritten like image

A python based project which will take image as plain text and give a image containing the text in handwritten like format

# Requirements
1. python3.6+
2. PIL library must be installed

All the necessary image files must be in the same directory as the python script

Run the script and it will prompt the user to enter the text.
As soon as the input is completed the image will be formed and shown.

You can decide to save it or not by taking a screenshot or whatever


# NOTE
The image formed will only be a temporary file and will be lost if not saved


You can add your own handwriting by creating the necessary image files

Thank you,
